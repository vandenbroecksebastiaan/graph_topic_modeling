# graph_topic_modeling

This repo presents a two-part analysis related to COVID-19.
On the one hand, graph mining has been applied on a flights dataset to analyse how centrality measures have changed before, during and after the pandemic.
On the other hand, topic modeling has been used on a dataset of research papers related to COVID-19 to check how the topics in the scientific literature changed before, during and after the pandemic.

A pdf of the presentation and report can be found in their respective folders: presentation/main.pdf and report/main.pdf.
All of the code is in the notebook in the root directory. Some of the data has not been included in the repo, since the dataset size would be too large.
The instructions for downloading the code yourself can be found in the notebook as well.
